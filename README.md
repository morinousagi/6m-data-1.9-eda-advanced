# **1.9 EDA Advanced: Data Wrangling & Analysis**

## **Course Overview**

This module transforms basic Python knowledge into professional data manipulation skills using a **Flipped Classroom** approach. Learners will move from theoretical understanding to hands-on application of complex data wrangling tasks.

## **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this module, learners will be able to:

1. **Master Time Series:** Handle datetime objects, resample frequencies, and calculate rolling statistics (moving averages) on financial data.  
2. **Wrangle & Merge:** Combine multiple data sources using SQL-style joins and reshape data layouts (Wide vs. Long) for analysis.  
3. **Aggregate & Report:** Create executive-level summaries using GroupBy, Pivot Tables, and Cross-Tabulations.
